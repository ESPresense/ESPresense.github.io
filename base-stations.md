# Base Stations

The firmware is currently compatible with the ESP32 WROOM and WROVER dual core (most common).  4MB of flash is required (most common).
We support the original ESP32, ESP32-C3, and the ESP32-S3 (S2 doesn't have bluetooth).  Make sure you do *NOT* buy a ESP8266, those do not have bluetooth at all.
