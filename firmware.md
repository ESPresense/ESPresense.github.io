# Firmware Installation

## Browser-Based Installer

Begin by connecting an ESP device to your computer using USB, then click the "Connect" button below:

{% include firmware.html %}

## Post-Flashing Steps

Upon successful firmware flashing, search for an Access Point (AP) with an SSID beginning with "ESPresense-". Connect to this network to access the configuration portal. For setup instructions, visit [Configuration Settings](/configuration/settings).

## Alpha / Nightly Builds

For those interested in experimental features, you can opt for a nightly/alpha build available [here](/alpha). Please note this is for adventurous users and may not be stable.
