# Home

An ESP32-based presence detection node designed for localized device tracking.

Reasons to use this over other solutions:

* ESP32 nodes are cheaper and easier to use than Raspberry Pis
* Extensive fingerprint-based IDs instead of MAC addresses for tracking or counting devices others can’t
* IRK-based enrollment of Apple devices to passively locate them uniquely, even with private random addresses
* Home Assistant MQTT Discovery for easy HA configuration
* Auto-updates by downloading GitHub-released binaries (optional, with a preference to disable if desired)
* Filters measured distance with both a median pre-filter and a 1Euro filter (reduces jitter for greater accuracy)
* Companion allows for full [multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration)

For the best experience, we recommend pairing ESPresense nodes with the [ESPresense Companion](./companion) Docker container/HA Add-on. ESPresense nodes provide distance measurements to nearby devices, and ESPresense Companion aggregates those distances from multiple nodes, using an accurate floor plan to determine each device's location within your space ([multilateration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilateration)).

While this setup allows for more precise presence detection and triangulation, it requires an accurate floor plan and at least 3 nodes covering each room to work effectively.

If you prefer to stick with the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) [`mqtt_room` component](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt_room/), it remains supported—though it is less capable and manually configured.
