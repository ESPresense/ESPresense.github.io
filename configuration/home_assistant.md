# Home Assistant

The Home Assistant integration consists of two parts:
1. **node sensors**: each ESP32 appears as a device automatically (because MQTT auto discovery), including entities to set max distance and disable/enable active scan or query
2. **beacons**: define each beacon in `configuration.yaml` (using [mqtt_room integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt_room/))

### beacons: MQTT device topics

Once the ESP32 is running, it is important to configure Home Assistant to use the information from the MQTT topic to determine what devices to track. You can read the full documentation [on the Home Assistant website](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.mqtt_room/). It is critical that you configure your device IDs to match the device fingerprint found by ESPresence (e.g. `apple:1007:11-12`).

#### connect to ESP32

The easiest way to find the fingerprint is to connect the usb cable and monitor the serial port (115200 baud) while bringing a device close to the ESP32. To monitor the serial port you can use the [ESPresense terminal](https://espresense.com/terminal).
Alternatives: e.g. Arduino monitor function, the `PlatformIO` VSCode [extension](https://diyprojects.io/install-ide-platformio-extension-visual-studio-code-vscode-windows-32-bit-linux/#.YTmXNNMzYZ8) or via platform io ``pio  run --target monitor``.

You should see output similar to the following:

```terminal
--- Miniterm on /dev/cu.usbserial-39522517AB  115200,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+C | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
0 New   | MAC: 67dc0c979510, ID: apple:0c0e:26
0 New   | MAC: 14dc290e58f2, ID: apple:0a01:5
1 Close | MAC: 4277f2521053, ID: apple:1007:11-12
```

The `Close` message will show which devices are under half a meter away. Once you move the device > 1m you will see a `Left` message.

#### monitor MQTT topics

Alternatively, you can monitor the MQTT topics using e.g. [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) or the monitoring built into the Home Assistant MQTT integration (Configure -> Listen to topic -> espresense/# -> Start listening will give you all taffic from all nodes).
Connect to the Home Assistant MQTT broker (same configuration as used for the ESPresence sensor setup).
This groups + shows the `rooms` and `devices`.

### MQTT auto discovery

ESPresense supports [MQTT auto discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery), which is enabled by default in Home Assistant.
This means a device + entities for each ESP32 sensor will automatically be created.

They appear as device + entities in Mosquitto broker card on the **integrations** page.

And available in the **devices** overview.

### beacons: configuration.yaml

Each beacon that should be monitored in Home Assistant needs to be added to the `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
sensor:
# One entry for each beacon you want to track
  - platform: mqtt_room
    device_id: "iTrack:xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    name: 'ESP Keys'
    state_topic: 'espresense/devices/iTrack:xxxxxxxxxxxx'
    timeout: 10
    away_timeout: 120
  - platform: mqtt_room
    device_id: "iBeacon:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-3-58241"
    name: 'ESP Chipolo'
    state_topic: 'espresense/devices/iBeacon:xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx-3-58241'
    timeout: 10
    away_timeout: 120
```
If you have enrolled a device with a specific name that becomes the device_id to track.

### sensors: manual configuration

Normally not needed, but in case [MQTT auto discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) is disabled, it is possible to manually add a `binary_sensor` for the ESP32 sensor.
Note: this does not add the entities that are normally added automatically: set max distance, active scan, query.

```yaml
mqtt:
  binary_sensor:
  # One entry per sensor node
    - unique_id: 'kitchen'
      name: 'Kitchen'
      state_topic: espresense/rooms/kitchen/status
      json_attributes_topic: espresense/rooms/kitchen/telemetry
      payload_on: online
      payload_off: offline
      device_class: connectivity
    - unique_id: 'living_room'
      name: 'Living Room'
      state_topic: espresense/rooms/living_room/status
      json_attributes_topic: espresense/rooms/living_room/telemetry
      payload_on: online
      payload_off: offline
      device_class: connectivity
    - unique_id: 'kid_room'
      name: 'Kid Room'
      state_topic: espresense/rooms/kid_room/status
      json_attributes_topic: espresense/rooms/kid_room/telemetry
      payload_on: online
      payload_off: offline
      device_class: connectivity
    - unique_id: 'master_bedroom'
      name: 'Master Bedroom'
      state_topic: espresense/rooms/master_bedroom/status
      json_attributes_topic: espresense/rooms/master_bedroom/telemetry
      payload_on: online
      payload_off: offline
      device_class: connectivity
```
